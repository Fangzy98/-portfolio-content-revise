            <p>FLUX: A touchless touchscreen for the Harn Museum of Art.</p>
            <p>In August 2020, I joined the Harn Museum of Art to participate in the design and development of an
                interactive system. At the time, the museum had purchased a touch-based exhibition software for the
                Korean
                Gallery. However, due to pandemic protocols, they had to stop using the original touch-screen
                interactive
                system. And while several touchless systems on the market could potentially replace the touch screen,
                their
                functions and expense far exceeded the museums' needs for a single exhibition. Therefore, the museum
                wanted
                us to upgrade the current interactive system in order to continue its use in the gallery. Since this
                project
                was my first challenge, I felt excited to proceed with the development, research, and user testing
                phases.
            </p>
            <p>
                After researching pre-existing solutions on the market, we decided to go with the gesture-based
                solution.
                We attached an external depth camera to the touch screen to capture a picture of user gestures. Using
                graphic
                algorithms and packages, we also enabled the user to control the mouse (touchpoint) and perform
                different
                interactive events through gestures. The project became more exhilarating once we transitioned the
                prototype
                into the gallery and began user testing. We found that different users would stand at different
                positions
                from the screen, which resulted in a deviation in the mapping between the original set palm movement
                distance and the cursor movement distance. To solve this problem, we enlarged the camera range to
                address
                the various standing distances.
