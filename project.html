                    <p>FLUX: A touchless touchscreen for the Harn Museum of Art.</p>
                    <p>In August 2020, I joined the Harn Museum of Art to participate in the design and development of an
                        interactive system. At the time, the museum had purchased a touch-based exhibition software for the
                        Korean
                        Gallery. However, due to pandemic protocols, they had to stop using the original touch-screen
                        interactive
                        system. And while several touchless systems on the market could potentially replace the touch screen,
                        their
                        functions and expense far exceeded the museums' needs for a single exhibition. Therefore, the museum
                        wanted
                        us to upgrade the current interactive system in order to continue its use in the gallery. Since this
                        project
                        was my first challenge, I felt excited to proceed with the development, research, and user testing
                        phases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After researching pre-existing solutions on the market, we decided to go with the gesture-based
                        solution.
                        We attached an external depth camera to the touch screen to capture a picture of user gestures. Using
                        graphic
                        algorithms and packages, we also enabled the user to control the mouse (touchpoint) and perform
                        different
                        interactive events through gestures. The project became more exhilarating once we transitioned the
                        prototype
                        into the gallery and began user testing. We found that different users would stand at different
                        positions
                        from the screen, which resulted in a deviation in the mapping between the original set palm movement
                        distance and the cursor movement distance. To solve this problem, we enlarged the camera range to
                        address
                        the various standing distances.
